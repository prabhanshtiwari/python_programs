Program 1: This program shows how to print a string like "Hello World", "Hi, I am learning Python" on the screen.
Here, we used a simple predefined function i.e., print() 
print("Hello World") --> Hello World
print("Hi, I am learning Python") --> Hi, I am learning Python

Program 2: This program shows how to take user input and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Here, we used a simple predefined function i.e., input() --> It always accepts values from use and convert the given value into str datatype.
To perform mathematical calculations, we need numeric datatypes like int, float or complex.
