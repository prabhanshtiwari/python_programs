This repository contains python programs

Program 1: This program shows how to print a string like "Hello World", "Hi, I am learning Python" on the screen.
Here, we used a simple predefined function i.e., print() 
print("Hello World") --> Hello World
print("Hi, I am learning Python") --> Hi, I am learning Python

Program 2: This program shows how to take user input and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Here, we used a simple predefined function i.e., input() --> It always accepts values from use and convert the given value into str datatype.
To perform mathematical calculations, we need numeric datatypes like int, float or complex.
In this program, we have converted the values given by user from str to int
int() --> converts into int datatype
For additon, we used the formula, addition = num1 + num2, here, addition variable will contain the result of num1 + num2
For subtraction, we used the formula, subtraction = num1 - num2, here, num2 will get subtracted from num1, and subtraction variable will contain the result of num1 - num2
For multiplication, we used the formula, product = num 1 * num2, here, product variable will contain the result of num1 * num2
For division, we used the formula, num1 / num2, here we are considering num1 as numerator and num2 as denominator. For the process of division, we are using if-else statement. If the given condition i.e., (num2 != 0) is true, then "quotient = num1 / num2" is executed. If the condition is false, then the string "Can't divide by zero" gets printed.

Program 3: In this program, we have used three variables (height, width and depth) and we calculated the volume of cube by using the formula "volume = height * width * depth" and then we displayed this volume on the screen.

Program 4: In this program, we have taken radius as input, and we have displayed the area and circumference of circle on the screen.

Program 5: This is the program fro calculating "sum" anf "average".
Formula for sum and average are given: 
sum = sum of total given numbers = number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5
average = sum of total given numbers / total number of given numbers = sum / 5

Program 6: In this program, we tried to solve the given equations based on the given values.

Program 7: In this program, we tried to show you the use of type() function. type() function is used to get the datatype of any variable.

Program 8: In this program, we have calculated the semi-perimeter and area of the triangle by using Heron's Formula.
Semi-perimeter --> s=(a+b+c)/2
Area of triangle -->  area=âˆš (s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) or use (s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))**0.5

Program 9:
